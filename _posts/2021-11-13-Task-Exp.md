title: "My Experience with the amFOSS Tasks!"
---

**Hello** today I am going to speak about my experience with the amFOSS tasks.

I am having a lot of fun doing the tasks as they have helped me know more about the world of computers and programming.
I have learned about new languages like **go**, **js**, **flutter** and thus have created my first android app.
I have also learned about **web-scraping** and creating **python based api's**.

I have to say that these tasks have helped me broaden my understanding of computers and programming languages. If it were not for these tasks I would probably not have learned about these. I had a lot of fun doing these tasks.
